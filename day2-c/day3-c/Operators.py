# List all the arithmetic operators that can be used in Python with a brief description of each.

x= 1+1 #for addition 
print(10*10)#fro multiplication
print(5-5)#for subtraction
print(3**3)# exponation for square 
print(4//5)# Division without float or decimal point
print(5%4)#returns the remainder of the two numbers
print(5/7) #for divison
